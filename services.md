title: Copywriting for Booksellers

<h1 style="font-weight: 500">Welcome.</h1>

You’re in the book game, so I know you’re a reader. You love books as much as I do. Writing reviews and recommendations for the books in your inventory seems like it would be easy, right? But there just aren’t enough hours in the day for you to do it all.
You’ve tried to keep up with your blog posts of new releases, but you just don’t have the time to crank out blogs on a regular basis. You wrote that great blog on the “5 Best Biographies on Eleanor Roosevelt”, but you need to move some inventory that appeals to a (ahem) wider audience. Or maybe you’re just too busy right now to read that new release, but you don’t feel right marketing a book you haven’t read yourself. How could you possibly keep up?

Enter me. I’ll help carry the load.

Through regular newsletters, emails, and blogs (just like mine!), I’ll illustrate to your customers what you already know to be true: that every book on your shelves is worth reading and worth buying.

Through my copywriting services I can…

- Boost your SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and move you on up the Google ranks
- Drive traffic to your site
- Grow your email list
- Keep your current customers in the know about what’s new
- Help you grow your rad book business

Sound good to you?

<h1 style="font-weight: 500">About Me.</h1>

Hi, I’m Emily. I’m a freelance copywriter and a book nerd.

A former librarian, I love reading and recommending books for readers of all ages. I write marketing copy for book sellers so that they can bring attention to their books in the same way that I do with Project Emily.

Independent bookstores have something really special to offer readers and I want to do everything I can to help you get more books into your customer’s hands.

I live with my best friend (who I happen to be married to) in the Texas Hill Country.
