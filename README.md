```

### Navigation Bar

Set in the main navigation links in `_data/navbar_primary.yml`:

```yaml
- title: About
  url: /about/
```

### Widgets

Set in the page sidebar and footer sidebar widgets in `_data/sidebars.yml`. Chose from the following widgets: `categories`, `recent`, `authors`, `about`, links. Edit copyright notice in about widget in `_config.yml`:

```yaml
footer:
  copyright:
```

### Enabling comments (via Disqus)

Optionally, if you have a Disqus account, you can tell Jekyll to use it to show a comments section below each post. To enable it, add the following lines to your Jekyll site:

```yaml
disqus:
  shortname: my_disqus_shortname
```

You can find out more about Disqus' shortnames [here](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466208).

Comments are enabled by default and will only appear in production, i.e., `JEKYLL_ENV=production`. If you don't want to display comments for a particular post you can disable them by adding `comments: false` to that post's YAML Front Matter.

### Google Analytics

To enable Google Anaytics, add the following lines to your Jekyll site:

```yaml
google_analytics: UA-NNNNNNNN-N
```

Google Analytics will only appear in production, i.e., `JEKYLL_ENV=production`

### Contact Form (via FormSpree)

Submit the form and confirm your email address at [FormSpree](https://formspree.io/). Then add the following code to page content:

```
{% include formspree.html email="my_name@gmail.com" redirect="/thanks/" %}
```

### Update favicon

You can find the current favicon (favicon.png) inside the theme `/uploads/` directory, just replace it with your new favicon.

## Posts

To create a new post, you can create a new markdown file inside the `_posts` directory by following the recommended file naming format:

```
YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP
```

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. For example, the following are examples of valid post filenames:

```
2011-12-31-new-years-eve-is-awesome.md
2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.md
```

Post requires front matter, everything in between the first and second --- are part of the YAML Front Matter, and everything after the second --- will be rendered with Markdown and show up as “Content”.
The following is a post file with different configurations you can add as example:

```yaml
---
title: Best tech companies to work for in 2019
image: post-image.jpg # Upload the image to uploads directory
categories: [business] # Same as category post tag
tag: [spotlight, featured] # Optional: spotlight tag adds post to spotlight section, featured tag add post to featured section
hidden: true # Optional: exlude the post from blog page posts
author: sarah # Reference author username
---

```

You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `bundle exec jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To keep things more organized you can organize post images in subdirectiories e.g. `/uploads/2019/01/`.

### Adding images

To add an image to a post or page use the following codes:
Local image from `/uploads/` directory:

```yaml
{
  % include image.html img="girl.jpg" alt="Alt for image" caption="Girl on a rock" %,
}
```

External wide image with lightbox:

```yaml
{
  % include image.html img="https://source.unsplash.com/TT-ROxWj9nA.jpg" lightbox="true" alt="Alt for image" caption="Image in lightbox" %,
}
```

### Responsive Videos

Embed local videos:

```html
<video controls playsinline uk-video="automute: true">
  <source
    src="http://www.quirksmode.org/html5/videos/big_buck_bunny.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
  <source
    src="http://www.quirksmode.org/html5/videos/big_buck_bunny.ogv"
    type="video/ogg"
  />
</video>
```

Embed YouTube videos:

```html
<iframe
  src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/YE7VzlLtp-4?autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;playsinline=1"
  width="600"
  height="340"
  frameborder="0"
  allowfullscreen
  uk-responsive
  uk-video="automute: true"
></iframe>
```

To create a draft post, create the post file under the `_drafts` directory, and you can find more information in [Working with Drafts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/drafts/).

## Home Page

To create a home page, just create a `index.md` file inside the root directory. The following is a YAML Front Matter example for a page:

```yaml
---
layout: full
---

```

Home page sections are created using includes that can be easily rearranged and modified, e.g.:

```
{% include section-ad.html image="welcome.png" alt="Buy Étoile Jekyll Theme" width="" url="https://themeforest.net/user/pressapps/portfolio" blank="true" %}

{% include section-featured.html title="Featured Story" %}

{% include section-spotlight.html title="Spotlight" %}

{% include section-mailchimp.html title="Newsletter Signup" text="Sign up for our weekly newsletter through Mailchimp and stay up to date with what is happening in the city." button_text="Support Us" %}

{% include section-latest.html title="Latest Articles" limit="4" more="More Articles" %}

{% include section-ad.html title="Advertisement" image="https://via.placeholder.com/800x180/f4f4f4/fff.png?text=+" url="#" blank="true" %}

{% include section-authors.html title="Our Contributors" %}

{% include section-instagram.html title="Latest On Instagram" cols="4" count="4" gutter="true" %}

{% include section-cta.html title="Want To Contribute?" text="We are looking for writers from all walks of life to contribute to out blog, if you have something to say get in touch." button_text="Contact Us" button_url="/contact/" blank="true" %}

{% include section-author.html author="john" title="Hello, I am Jane! Welcome to my blog." %}
```

## Authors

To create an author, create a new post inside the `_authors` directory and add the following YAML Front Matter:

```
---

image:          avatar_john.jpg

---

$global-primary-background: #de7a93;
```
