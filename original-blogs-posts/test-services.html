                You’re in the book game, so I know you’re a reader. You love books as
                much as I do. Writing reviews and recommendations for the books in
                your inventory seems like it would be easy, right? But you’re having a
                hard time keeping up with it.<br /><br />
                You’ve tried to keep up with your blog posts of new releases, but you
                just don’t have the time to crank out blogs on a regular basis. You
                wrote that great blog on the “5 Best Biographies on Eleanor
                Roosevelt”, but you need to move some inventory that appeals to a
                (ahem) wider audience. Or maybe you’re just too busy right now to read
                that new release, but you don’t feel right marketing a book you
                haven’t read yourself. How could you possibly keep up?<br /><br />
                Enter me. I’ll help carry the load.<br /><br />
                Through regular newsletters, emails, and blogs (just like mine!), I’ll
                illustrate to your customers what you already know to be true: that
                every book on your shelves is worth reading and worth buying.<br />
